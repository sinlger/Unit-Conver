# Speed Unit Conversion Tool

Whether you're driving a car, navigating a ship, analyzing physics experiments, watching sports events, or planning travel routes, converting between speed units is a common requirement in both everyday and professional contexts. However, the relationships among metric units (e.g., m/s, km/h), imperial units (e.g., ft/s), and nautical-specific units (knots) are complex and prone to error.

To solve this problem, we present a professional **Speed Unit Conversion Tool** that supports instant, high-precision conversion among the following **5 internationally used speed units**:

- **Meters per second (m/s)** — the SI standard  
- **Kilometers per hour (km/h)** — used globally for road speed limits and vehicle dashboards  
- **Meters per hour (m/h)** — for extremely slow speeds (e.g., geological movement, precision instruments)  
- **Knot (knot)** — the standard in maritime and aviation (1 knot = 1 nautical mile per hour)  
- **Feet per second (ft/s)** — commonly used in U.S. engineering and physics calculations  

Simply enter a value, select the source and target units, and get an accurate result instantly!

## 🔁 Core Speed Conversion Formulas

### Reference Values (in meters per second)

| Unit        | Equivalent in m/s             |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| 1 m/s       | 1                             |
| 1 km/h      | ≈ 0.277778 m/s                |
| 1 m/h       | ≈ 0.000277778 m/s             |
| 1 knot      | = 0.514444 m/s                |
| 1 ft/s      | ≈ 0.3048 m/s                  |

### Key Definitions
- **1 knot = 1 nautical mile per hour**, and **1 nautical mile = 1,852 meters** (international standard)  
- **1 foot (ft) = 0.3048 meters** (exact)

### Common Conversion Formulas

| Conversion Direction | Formula                     |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| m/s → km/h           | `km/h = m/s × 3.6`          |
| km/h → m/s           | `m/s = km/h ÷ 3.6`          |
| m/s → knot           | `knot = m/s ÷ 0.514444`     |
| knot → km/h          | `km/h = knot × 1.852`       |
| ft/s → m/s           | `m/s = ft/s × 0.3048`       |
| m/h → m/s            | `m/s = m/h ÷ 3,600`         |
| km/h → ft/s          | `ft/s = km/h × 0.911344`    |

## 🚗 Common Speed Unit Reference Table

| m/s    | km/h   | m/h      | knot   | ft/s    |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|---------|
| 0.2778 | 1      | 1,000    | 0.540  | 0.911   |
| 1      | 3.6    | 3,600    | 1.944  | 3.281   |
| 5      | 18     | 18,000   | 9.719  | 16.404  |
| 10     | 36     | 36,000   | 19.438 | 32.808  |
| 20     | 72     | 72,000   | 38.877 | 65.617  |
| 27.78  | 100    | 100,000  | 54.0   | 91.134  |
| 51.44  | 185.2  | 185,200  | 100    | 168.781 |
