# Temperature Unit Conversion Tool

In scientific research, engineering design, weather forecasting, international travel, and even daily life, we often need to convert between different temperature units. However, the conversion formulas among Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin, and Rankine can be complex and easy to mix up—don’t worry!

Our professional **Temperature Unit Converter** supports instant, high-precision bidirectional conversion among the following **four internationally used temperature scales**:

- **Celsius (°C)** — the most widely used scale for everyday temperatures worldwide  
- **Kelvin (K)** — the thermodynamic temperature standard in the International System of Units (SI)  
- **Fahrenheit (°F)** — commonly used in the United States and some Caribbean countries  
- **Rankine (°R)** — an absolute temperature scale used in engineering thermodynamics (imperial system)  

Just enter a value, select the original and target units, and get an accurate result instantly—no need to memorize formulas or risk calculation errors!

## 🔁 Core Temperature Conversion Formulas

Below are the exact conversion relationships among the four scales:

| Conversion Direction | Formula                                |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| °C → K               | `K = °C + 273.15`                      |
| K → °C               | `°C = K − 273.15`                      |
| °C → °F              | `°F = (°C × 9/5) + 32`                 |
| °F → °C              | `°C = (°F − 32) × 5/9`                 |
| °F → °R              | `°R = °F + 459.67`                     |
| °R → °F              | `°F = °R − 459.67`                     |
| K → °R               | `°R = K × 9/5`                         |
| °R → K               | `K = °R × 5/9`                         |
| °C → °R              | `°R = (°C + 273.15) × 9/5`             |
| °F → K               | `K = (°F − 32) × 5/9 + 273.15`         |

💡 **Did You Know?**  
- **0 K (absolute zero)** is the theoretical lowest possible temperature, equal to **−273.15°C** or **−459.67°F**.  
- Both **Kelvin (K)** and **Rankine (°R)** are *absolute temperature scales*—they have no negative values.
