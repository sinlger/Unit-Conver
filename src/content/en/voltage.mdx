# Voltage Unit Conversion Tool

In electronic engineering, power systems, laboratory measurements, medical devices, and even everyday use of consumer electronics, voltage unit conversion is a fundamental and critical operation. Whether you're working with faint bioelectric signals (in the millivolt range), standard household voltages (e.g., 220 V), or high-voltage transmission lines (thousands of volts), rapid and accurate conversion across different orders of magnitude is essential.

To meet this need, we present a professional **Voltage Unit Converter** that supports instant, high-precision conversion among the following **three commonly used voltage units**:

- **Volt (V)** — the base SI unit of electric potential  
- **Millivolt (mV)** — one-thousandth of a volt; widely used in sensors and physiological signals (e.g., ECG)  
- **Kilovolt (kV)** — equal to 1,000 volts; common in power transmission, industrial equipment, and high-voltage experiments  

Simply enter a value, select the original and target units, and get an accurate result instantly!

## 🔁 Voltage Unit Conversion Formulas

All conversions are based on decimal SI prefixes, ensuring clear and straightforward relationships:

| Conversion Direction | Formula                     |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| V → mV               | `mV = V × 1,000`            |
| mV → V               | `V = mV ÷ 1,000`            |
| V → kV               | `kV = V ÷ 1,000`            |
| kV → V               | `V = kV × 1,000`            |
| mV → kV              | `kV = mV ÷ 1,000,000`       |
| kV → mV              | `mV = kV × 1,000,000`       |

💡 **Did You Know?**  
- The generally accepted **safe voltage for humans** is **≤ 36 V** in dry conditions.  
- A standard **AA battery** outputs **1.5 V = 1,500 mV**.  
- **Urban high-voltage transmission lines** can reach **110 kV** or even **500 kV**.
