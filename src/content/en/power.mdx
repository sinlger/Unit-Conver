# Power Unit Conversion Tool

Whether you're evaluating appliance energy consumption, designing electrical circuits, analyzing renewable energy generation capacity, or reading news reports (e.g., “a wind farm with 500 MW installed capacity”), power unit conversion is a frequent task for engineers, students, energy professionals, and everyday users.

Power units span an enormous range—from the few **milliwatts (mW)** of a headphone output, to the **kilowatts (kW)** of a household air conditioner, up to **gigawatt (GW)**-scale outputs of nuclear power plants. Manual conversions are not only tedious but also prone to errors—especially when misjudging orders of magnitude.

To address this, we offer a professional **Power Unit Conversion Tool** that supports instant, high-precision conversion among the following **5 internationally recognized power units**:

- **Watt (W)** — the SI base unit of power  
- **Milliwatt (mW)** — one-thousandth of a watt; commonly used in electronics and audio signals  
- **Kilowatt (kW)** — standard for household appliances, electric vehicles, and small generators  
- **Megawatt (MW)** — typical for wind farms, large factories, and city-scale power supply  
- **Gigawatt (GW)** — used for national grids, large hydroelectric or nuclear power stations  

Simply enter a value, select the source and target units, and get an accurate result instantly!

## 🔁 Power Unit Conversion Formulas

All units follow the decimal-based SI prefixes, ensuring clear and consistent relationships:

| Conversion Direction | Formula                     |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| W → mW               | `mW = W × 1,000`            |
| mW → W               | `W = mW ÷ 1,000`            |
| W → kW               | `kW = W ÷ 1,000`            |
| kW → W               | `W = kW × 1,000`            |
| kW → MW              | `MW = kW ÷ 1,000`           |
| MW → kW              | `kW = MW × 1,000`           |
| MW → GW              | `GW = MW ÷ 1,000`           |
| GW → MW              | `MW = GW × 1,000`           |
| W → GW               | `GW = W ÷ 1,000,000,000`    |
| mW → GW              | `GW = mW ÷ 1,000,000,000,000` |
