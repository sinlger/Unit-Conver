## 🔁 Core Length Conversion Formulas

### Metric Units (based on the meter)

| Conversion | Formula                |
|-----------|------------------------|
| mm → cm   | `cm = mm ÷ 10`         |
| cm → m    | `m = cm ÷ 100`         |
| m → km    | `km = m ÷ 1,000`       |
| mm → m    | `m = mm ÷ 1,000`       |
| cm → km   | `km = cm ÷ 100,000`    |

### Imperial Units

| Conversion | Formula                |
|-----------|------------------------|
| in → ft   | `ft = in ÷ 12`         |
| ft → yd   | `yd = ft ÷ 3`          |
| yd → mi   | `mi = yd ÷ 1,760`      |
| in → yd   | `yd = in ÷ 36`         |

💡 **Note**:  
- **International foot (ft)** is the global standard: **1 ft = 0.3048 m**  
- **U.S. survey foot (ft-us)** is used in U.S. geodetic surveys: **1 ft-us ≈ 0.3048006096 m**  
  (The difference is negligible for most applications but matters in high-precision surveying.)

### Metric ↔ Imperial Key Reference Values

| Base Relationship        | Exact Value             |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1 inch (in)              | = 25.4 millimeters (mm) |
| 1 meter (m)              | = 39.3701 inches (in)   |
| 1 foot (ft)              | = 0.3048 meters (m)     |
| 1 yard (yd)              | = 0.9144 meters (m)     |
| 1 mile (mi)              | = 1.609344 kilometers (km) |
