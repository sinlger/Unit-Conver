# Pressure Unit Conversion Tool

In engineering design, weather forecasting, automotive maintenance, medical devices, aerospace applications, and even everyday tasks like checking tire pressure, pressure unit conversion is ubiquitous. However, the coexistence of different measurement systems—from the SI unit **pascal (Pa)** to the U.S.-common **psi**, meteorological **hPa**, and industrial **bar**—makes manual conversions highly error-prone.

To solve this problem, we introduce a professional **Pressure Unit Conversion Tool** that supports instant, high-precision conversion among the following **8 mainstream pressure units**:

- **Pascal (Pa)** — the SI base unit  
- **Kilopascal (kPa)** and **Megapascal (MPa)** — commonly used in engineering and material strength  
- **Hectopascal (hPa)** — standard in meteorology (1 hPa = 1 millibar)  
- **Bar (bar)** — widely used in European industry and tire pressure  
- **Torr (torr)** — common in vacuum systems and medicine (≈1 mmHg)  
- **Pounds per square inch (psi)** and **kilopounds per square inch (ksi)** — standard in U.S. engineering and mechanical fields

| 1 MPa       | 1,000,000                        |
| 1 bar       | 100,000                          |
| 1 torr      | ≈ 133.322                        |
| 1 psi       | ≈ 6,894.76                       |
| 1 ksi       | ≈ 6,894,760                      |

### Key Definitions
- **1 bar = 10⁵ Pa** (exact)  
- **1 standard atmosphere (atm) ≈ 101,325 Pa = 760 torr = 14.6959 psi**  
- **1 torr ≈ 1 mmHg** (millimeter of mercury), used in blood pressure and vacuum measurements  
- **1 ksi = 1,000 psi**

### Common Conversion Formulas

| Conversion Direction | Formula                     |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| Pa → kPa             | `kPa = Pa ÷ 1,000`          |
| kPa → MPa            | `MPa = kPa ÷ 1,000`         |
| bar → Pa             | `Pa = bar × 100,000`        |
| psi → kPa            | `kPa = psi × 6.89476`       |
| MPa → psi            | `psi = MPa × 145.038`       |
| torr → Pa            | `Pa = torr × 133.322`       |
| hPa → bar            | `bar = hPa ÷ 1,000`         |
| ksi → MPa            | `MPa = ksi × 6.89476`       |
