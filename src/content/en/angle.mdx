# Angle Unit Conversion Tool

In mathematics, physics, engineering drafting, astronomy, geodetic surveying, and even game development, angles are represented in a variety of units. Different fields favor different conventions:

- **Radians (rad)**: The SI standard unit, used extensively in advanced mathematics and physics.  
- **Degrees (°)**: The most widely recognized unit, commonly used in everyday contexts and basic education.  
- **Gradians (grad)**: Also known as "gons" or "percentages of a right angle," frequently used in parts of Europe and civil engineering.  
- **Arcminutes (arcmin)** and **arcseconds (arcsec)**: Employed in astronomy, navigation, and optics to express very small angular measurements.

Manually converting between these units is not only tedious but also prone to errors—especially when dealing with π or base-60 systems. To address this, we present a professional **Angle Unit Conversion Tool** that supports seamless, high-precision conversion among the following five common angular units:

- Radians (rad)  
- Degrees (deg)  
- Gradians (grad)  
- Arcminutes (arcmin)  
- Arcseconds (arcsec)  

Simply input a value, select the source and target units, and obtain an accurate result instantly!

## 🔁 Core Conversion Formulas

All conversions are based on the definition of a full circle = 360°.

| Unit        | Equivalent in Degrees (°)              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1 rad       | ≈ 57.295779513°                        |
| 1 grad      | = 0.9°                                 |
| 1 arcmin    | = 1/60° ≈ 0.0166667°                   |
| 1 arcsec    | = 1/3600° ≈ 0.000277778°               |

💡 **Key Constants**:  
- π radians = 180° → 1 rad = 180/π ≈ 57.2958°  
- A full circle = 400 gradians (the gradian system defines a right angle as 100 grad)

### Common Conversion Formulas

| Direction         | Formula                                      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| deg → rad         | `rad = deg × π / 180`                        |
| rad → deg         | `deg = rad × 180 / π`                        |
| deg → grad        | `grad = deg × 10/9`                          |
| grad → deg        | `deg = grad × 0.9`                           |
| deg → arcmin      | `arcmin = deg × 60`                          |
| arcmin → deg      | `deg = arcmin ÷ 60`                          |
| arcmin → arcsec   | `arcsec = arcmin × 60`                       |
| deg → arcsec      | `arcsec = deg × 3,600`                       |
| rad → arcsec      | `arcsec = rad × (180/π) × 3,600 ≈ rad × 206,264.8` |
