# Data Storage and Transfer Unit Converter

When using computers, smartphones, cloud storage, or internet services, have you ever wondered:

- Why does a “100 Mbps broadband” connection only give a download speed of about **12.5 MB/s**?  
- Why does a hard drive labeled **1 TB** show less than **1000 GB** in your operating system?  
- What’s the actual difference between **Kb** and **KB**?

The root cause lies in two common sources of confusion:  
1. The distinction between **bits (bit)** and **bytes (Byte)**  
2. The difference between **decimal (SI)** and **binary (IEC)** standards  

To solve this problem, we’ve developed a professional **Data Unit Conversion Tool** that supports intelligent conversion among the following **10 commonly used units**:

- **Bit series (lowercase)**: b (bit), Kb, Mb, Gb, Tb  
- **Byte series (uppercase)**: B (Byte), KB, MB, GB, TB  

✅ By default, the tool uses the **decimal (SI) standard** (1 KB = 1,000 B), but also offers an optional **binary (IEC) mode** (1 KiB = 1,024 B) to suit different scenarios.

## 🔁 Core Conversion Formulas

### 1. Relationship Between Bits and Bytes
- **1 Byte (B) = 8 bits (b)**  
  Therefore:  
  - `B = b ÷ 8`  
  - `b = B × 8`

### 2. Decimal (SI) Standard  
*(Used for hard drives, network bandwidth, etc.)*

| Unit        | Conversion Relationship      |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| 1 Kb        | = 1,000 b                    |
| 1 Mb        | = 1,000 Kb                   |
| 1 Gb        | = 1,000 Mb                   |
| 1 Tb        | = 1,000 Gb                   |
| 1 KB        | = 1,000 B                    |
| 1 MB        | = 1,000 KB                   |
| 1 GB        | = 1,000 MB                   |
| 1 TB        | = 1,000 GB                   |

### 3. Binary (IEC) Standard  
*(Used by operating systems, memory, etc.—optional mode)*

| Unit        | Conversion Relationship      |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| 1 KiB       | = 1,024 B                    |
| 1 MiB       | = 1,024 KiB                  |
| 1 GiB       | = 1,024 MiB                  |
| 1 TiB       | = 1,024 GiB                  |

💡 **Quick Tip**:  
- **Network bandwidth** (e.g., 100 Mbps) uses **lowercase b** for **bits**  
- **File sizes** (e.g., 500 MB) use **uppercase B** for **Bytes**  
→ Hence: **100 Mbps ÷ 8 = 12.5 MB/s** (maximum theoretical download speed)

## 💾 Common Data Unit Reference Table  
*(Based on decimal SI standard: 1 KB = 1,000 B, 1 Kb = 1,000 b)*
