# Illuminance Unit Converter

In lighting design, architectural daylighting assessment, photographic lighting setup, greenhouse management in agriculture, and workplace safety compliance, **illuminance** (light intensity) is a critical parameter. However, different regions around the world use different illuminance units:

- **Lux (lx)**: The SI (International System of Units) standard, widely used in China, Europe, and most countries  
- **Foot-candle (ft-cd)**: Commonly used in the United States, especially in building codes, film/TV production, and HVAC design  

Since these units are based on different length standards (meter vs. foot), their conversion factor is not an integer—making manual calculations prone to errors.

To solve this, we introduce a professional **Illuminance Unit Converter** that supports instant, bidirectional conversion between **lux (lx)** and **foot-candles (ft-cd)**—helping you cross the unit divide quickly and accurately!

## 🔁 Illuminance Conversion Formulas

Illuminance is defined as luminous flux per unit area (measured in lumens per square meter or square foot).  
Given that **1 meter = 3.28084 feet**, the area ratio is **(3.28084)² ≈ 10.7639**.

### Core Conversion Relationships

| Direction     | Formula                     |
|---------------|-----------------------------|
| lx → ft-cd    | `ft-cd = lx ÷ 10.7639`      |
| ft-cd → lx    | `lx = ft-cd × 10.7639`      |

💡 **Exact value**:  
**1 ft-cd = 10.7639104167 lx**  
(For most engineering purposes, using **10.764** provides sufficient precision.)
