# Mass Unit Conversion Guide

In daily life, academic study, scientific research, or international trade, are you often confused by the variety of mass units? Milligrams (mg), grams (g), kilograms (kg), metric tons (mt), micrograms (mcg), ounces (oz), pounds (lb), long tons (t)... These units may look similar but represent vastly different magnitudes.

Don’t worry! We’ve developed a smart **Mass Unit Converter** specifically to solve your conversion headaches!

## Supported Units

Our tool supports instant conversion among **8 commonly used mass units**:

- mcg (microgram)  
- mg (milligram)  
- g (gram)  
- kg (kilogram)  
- mt (metric tonne)  
- oz (ounce)  
- lb (pound)  
- t (long ton)

| Unit | Full Name / Description               | Equivalent in Grams (g)                     |
|------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| mcg  | Microgram                              | 1 mcg = 0.000001 g (1 × 10⁻⁶ g)             |
| mg   | Milligram                              | 1 mg = 0.001 g (1 × 10⁻³ g)                 |
| g    | Gram                                   | 1 g = 1 g                                   |
| kg   | Kilogram                               | 1 kg = 1,000 g                              |
| mt   | Metric tonne                           | 1 mt = 1,000 kg = 1,000,000 g               |
| oz   | Ounce (avoirdupois)                    | 1 oz ≈ 28.349523125 g                       |
| lb   | Pound                                  | 1 lb = 16 oz ≈ 453.59237 g                  |
| t    | Long ton (imperial ton)                | 1 t = 2,240 lb ≈ 1,016.0469088 kg ≈ 1,016,046.9088 g |

> **Note**:  
> - **mt** refers to the **metric ton** (also called tonne), equal to **1,000 kg**.  
> - **t** here denotes the **long ton** (used in the UK).  
> - For the **short ton** (used in the US): 1 short ton = 2,000 lb ≈ 907.185 kg. Please verify unit labels carefully in your context.

## 🔁 Quick Conversion Formulas

### Base Conversions (using gram as reference)
- `g = mcg ÷ 1,000,000`   `mcg = g × 1,000,000`  
- `g = mg ÷ 1,000`     `mg = g × 1,000`  
- `g = kg × 1,000`     `kg = g ÷ 1,000`  
- `g = mt × 1,000,000`   `mt = g ÷ 1,000,000`

### Imperial System (using pound as bridge)
- `lb = oz ÷ 16`      `oz = lb × 16`  
- `g = lb × 453.59237`  `lb = g ÷ 453.59237`  
- `g = oz × 28.349523125` (since 453.59237 ÷ 16 = 28.349523125)  
- `lb = t × 2,240`     `t = lb ÷ 2,240`  
- `g = t × 1,016,046.9088` (since 2,240 × 453.59237 = 1,016,046.9088)

All conversions are based on the **International System of Units (SI)** and internationally accepted constants, ensuring high precision and consistency.

## 🧪 Practical Use Cases

- **Students**: Homework in physics/chemistry (e.g., mcg → mg → g)  
- **Fitness & Health**: Vitamin/supplement dosages ([mcg ↔ mg](/mass/mcg-to-mg))  
- **Baking**: Converting U.S. recipes (e.g., 8 oz flour → 227 g)  
- **International Trade**: Order weights (e.g., 500 lb → 226.8 kg)  
- **Engineering/Logistics**: Cargo weight (e.g., 2.5 mt ≈ 2,500 kg)
