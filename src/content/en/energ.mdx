# Energy Unit Conversion Tool

In everyday electricity usage, battery capacity evaluation, renewable energy reporting, physics experiments, and even interpreting utility bills, converting between energy units is essential. However, **engineering and daily life** commonly use the **watt-hour (Wh) family** (e.g., mWh, kWh), while **scientific contexts** predominantly rely on the **joule (J) family** (e.g., kJ). These two systems differ fundamentally, making conversions error-prone.

To solve this problem, we introduce a professional **Energy Unit Conversion Tool** that supports instant, high-precision conversion among the following **7 widely used energy units**:

- Milliwatt-hours (mWh)  
- Watt-hours (Wh)  
- Kilowatt-hours (kWh) — the standard unit for household electricity billing (“1 kWh = 1 unit of electricity”)  
- Megawatt-hours (MWh)  
- Gigawatt-hours (GWh)  
- Joules (J) — the SI base unit of energy  
- Kilojoules (kJ)  

Simply enter a value, select the source and target units, and get an accurate result in seconds!

## 🔁 Core Energy Conversion Formulas

### Fundamental Relationship: Watt-hour ↔ Joule  
⚡ **1 watt-hour (Wh) = 3,600 joules (J)**  
*(Because 1 W = 1 J/s, and 1 hour = 3,600 seconds → 1 Wh = 1 J/s × 3,600 s = 3,600 J)*

From this, all other conversions are derived:

| Conversion Direction | Formula                     |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| Wh → J               | `J = Wh × 3,600`            |
| J → Wh               | `Wh = J ÷ 3,600`            |
| kWh → J              | `J = kWh × 3,600,000`       |
| J → kJ               | `kJ = J ÷ 1,000`            |
| mWh → Wh             | `Wh = mWh ÷ 1,000`          |
| Wh → kWh             | `kWh = Wh ÷ 1,000`          |
| kWh → MWh            | `MWh = kWh ÷ 1,000`         |
| MWh → GWh            | `GWh = MWh ÷ 1,000`         |
| GWh → J              | `J = GWh × 3.6e12`          |
