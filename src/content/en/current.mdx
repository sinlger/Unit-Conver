# Electric Current Unit Converter

In electronic engineering, power systems, laboratory research, and even everyday use of electronic devices, converting between electric current units is a fundamental yet critical task. To help engineers, students, and hobbyists quickly and accurately perform these conversions, we present an **online electric current unit converter**—supporting instant, bidirectional conversion among three commonly used units: **Amperes (A)**, **milliamperes (mA)**, and **kiloamperes (kA)**!

Whether you're designing circuits, debugging equipment, or completing homework assignments, simply enter a value and get precise results in seconds—eliminating tedious manual calculations and the risk of errors.

## 🔁 Current Unit Conversion Formulas

Below are the basic relationships among the three units:

- 1 Ampere (A) = 1,000 milliamperes (mA)  
- 1 Ampere (A) = 0.001 kiloamperes (kA)  
- 1 kiloampere (kA) = 1,000 Amperes (A)  
- 1 milliampere (mA) = 0.001 Amperes (A)

### General Conversion Formulas

| Conversion Direction | Formula                     |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| A → mA               | `mA = A × 1,000`            |
| mA → A               | `A = mA ÷ 1,000`            |
| A → kA               | `kA = A × 0.001`            |
| kA → A               | `A = kA × 1,000`            |
| mA → kA              | `kA = mA × 0.000001`        |
| kA → mA              | `mA = kA × 1,000,000`       |

## 📊 Common Current Unit Conversion Reference Table

| Amperes (A) | Milliamperes (mA) | Kiloamperes (kA) |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 0.001       | 1                 | 0.000001         |
| 0.01        | 10                | 0.00001          |
| 0.1         | 100               | 0.0001           |
| 1           | 1,000             | 0.001            |
| 10          | 10,000            | 0.01             |
| 100         | 100,000           | 0.1              |
| 1,000       | 1,000,000         | 1                |
| 5,000       | 5,000,000         | 5                |

💡 **Quick Tip**:  
A typical smartphone charger outputs **1–2 A** (i.e., **1,000–2,000 mA**), while industrial arc furnaces may operate with currents as high as **tens of kA**!
